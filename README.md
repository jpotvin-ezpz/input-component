<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/jpotvin-ezpz/input-component/blob/main/Screenshot_2021-03-24%20React%20App.png)

The challenge here was to create a reusable react component that could be rendered differently based on what props were passed to it.
I was stumped for quite awhile on this one until I realized I was overthinking it and all that was really needed was to style classes and create a few conditional statements to deal with multiline or the addition of icons.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-;ang.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TSqutYM4c5WtluM7QzGp) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
User Stories:

- User story: I can see error state
- User story: I can choose to disable input
- User story: I can choose to have helper text
- User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- User story: I can have different input sizes
- User story: I can have different colors
- User story: I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
- User story: I can have multiline input like a textarea
- User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- User story: I can still access all input attributes
- User story (optional): Show input in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough
